abstract: "Do the characteristics of our neighbour’s house affect how we
view our own home? In this paper, I examine the importance of
local comparisons in housing assessments by testing whether the
size of one’s home relative to others in their neighbourhood influences
their housing satisfaction. I use a unique feature of the
1993 American Housing Survey, in which the US Census Bureau
randomly surveyed 988 housing units around the country and a
cluster of approximately 10 of their nearest neighbours. I use
these data to test whether a unit’s relative size in its neighbourhood
influences the occupant’s housing satisfaction while controlling
for a series of occupant and unit characteristics. I find
evidence that relative position matters. Those living in comparatively
small houses are more likely to express dissatisfaction with
their home than people living in units that are large relative to
other houses in their neighbourhood cluster."
