abstract: In December 2018, the Minneapolis city council approved anew comprehensive plan that, once implemented, will make Minneapolis the first major city in the country to eliminate the use of single-family zoning restrictions. In this project, I study the initial impact of this pro-posed change on the sales prices of affected properties. I estimate a seriesof difference-in-differences models comparing the price of properties with3-kilometers of the Minneapolis border in the year before and year afterthe  city  adopted  the  plan.  I  find  that  compared  to  similar  unaffectedproperties in surrounding cities, the Minneapolis plan change was associated with a 3 and 5 percentage point increase in the price of affectedproperties. Additionally, I find some evidence that this price increase isdue to the new development option it offers property owners. I find that the plan-related price increases are larger in inexpensive neighborhoods and for properties that are small relative to their immediate neighbors. While we should be cautious drawing too much significance from these initial results, they provide some evidence that there is demand for denser housing in Minneapolis.
