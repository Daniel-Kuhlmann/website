&lt;p&gt;First, combine all the NST downloads into one file.
For some reason, the House.Number sometimes uploads as a
factor and other times as a integer. Won’t merge unless I use the
mutate. There must be a better was to do this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the summarise command by group to count the number of demos each year for the time series graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create the cumulative chart, I had to use the mutate, cumsum command.
I still need to redo this for the other charts.&lt;/p&gt;

  mutate(hood = Neighborhood..imp..2012.) %&amp;gt;%

         (hood == &amp;quot;Glenville&amp;quot; |
          hood == &amp;quot;Broadway-Slavic Village&amp;quot; |
          hood == &amp;quot;Union-Miles&amp;quot; |
          hood == &amp;quot;Mount Pleasant&amp;quot; |
          hood == &amp;quot;Hough&amp;quot; |
          hood == &amp;quot;Kinsman&amp;quot; |
          hood == &amp;quot;St.Clair-Superior&amp;quot; |

          hood == &amp;quot;Buckeye-Woodhill&amp;quot; |
          hood == &amp;quot;Stockyards&amp;quot; |
          hood == &amp;quot;Clark-Fulton&amp;quot;)) %&amp;gt;%

&lt;p&gt;Now I can start creating the charts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates the cumulative demolitions by neighbrohoods gifs.&lt;/p&gt;
